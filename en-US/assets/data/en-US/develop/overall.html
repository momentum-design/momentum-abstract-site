<h1 id="overall">Overall</h1>
<p>momentum is a system with a design language and software architecture. Initially, our team created Cooperate UI in order to better unify Cisco&#39;s design language, and the momentum system was born out of this.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-new">What is new?</h2>
<p>Compared with the past, the present momentum is more systematic. We strengthen the associations between the intrinsic elements of momentum, while decoupling some system elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="static-elements">Static elements</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have released a new package momentum-abstract. You can find all design tokens, icons, sounds, etc. elements here. In the past, these elements were scattered within various software packages containing logic.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="automated-process">Automated process</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The momentum team started writing code tools to automate the release flow. This saves us a lot of errors caused by manual operations.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="tools-for-construction">Tools for construction</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have established the momentum-constructor code repository on github for publishing various construction tools.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="version-control">Version control</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The momentum team implemented a new version control plan, relying on the centralization and automation of momentum-abstract, which will be more reliable. At the same time, projects using the momentum-constructor building tool will be easier to upgrade to newer versions.</p>
<ul>
<li><h3 id="new-components">New components</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More new teams have joined momentum and they are helping us develop various component libraries.</p>

<p>The momentum system serves all aspects of the Cisco system, and you can get a feel for the momentum design by using Webex.</p>
